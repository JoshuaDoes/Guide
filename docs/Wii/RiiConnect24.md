Steps:
- Patching
  1. Open the IOS Patcher .zip and run patch.bat.
  2. Go through the instructions it gives you and then copy the WAD folder to your SD Card.
  3. Extract Wii Mod Lite and WiiXplorer then copy them to the apps folder on your SD Card.
  4. Load Wii Mod Lite.
  5. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, go to "WAD Manager" then navigate to the WAD folder.
  6. When IOS31.wad is highlighted, press +, and do the same for IOS80.wad. Then press A to install the WADs.
  7. After they installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channe.
  8. Load WiiXplorer.
  9. Go to Start -> Settings -> Boot Settings -> Enable NAND write access then select Yes for both dialogs that pop up.
  10. Press Back until you have reached the file explorer screen.
  11. Select the tiny blue SD Card icon, then select NAND.
  12. Navigate to shared2 > wc24. Hover over nwc24msg.cfg, press the + Button and select Copy.
  13. Select the NAND icon (which used to be the SD Card icon), then select SD.
  14. In the file explorer pane, press the + Button somewhere and select Paste.
  15. Put your SD Card back in your computer.
  16. Open the nwc24msg.cfg patcher .zip and drag and drop the nwc24msg.cfg you copied to your SD Card to the mail.exe program. A dialog box should open and close quickly, that's normal.
  17. Repeat steps 12-14 in reverse order, but select Paste for step 12 and Copy for step 14. A dialog box should pop up asking if you want to overwrite the file, say Yes.
