# RiiConnect24 Wii Guide
## Device: Wii
### Stage: Exploit - Twilight Hack

<i class="notice--danger">This guide is for the original Wii only. Do not use this on a Wii U!</i>

You will need:
- A Wii on system versions 3.2-3.4
   If you're on system versions 4.0-4.2 use [Bannerbomb](Bannerbomb) instead, or if on 4.3 use [Letterbomb](Letterbomb)
- An SD card with at least 128 MB of free space and a maximum size of 4GB
   It cannot be an **SDHC**
- [Twilight Princess' ZIP](404)
Steps:
Inside the zip file you will find versions of the hack for all three regions. You may copy all of them to your SD card, but you will need to choose the correct one to copy to your Wii based on your version of Zelda: Twilight Princess. USA users, additionally, need to determine the correct save slot to load once inside Twilight Princess. The easiest way to check your version is to compare the text string which is on the inner circle of the data surface with the ones below:

0. Ensure your SD card is formatted as FAT
   By default SD cards are formatted as FAT, so if you're not sure you may skip this step
- (Optional) If you have an existing Zelda save that you want to backup, do so before proceeding:
	1. Put your SD card in your Wii and turn it on
	2. Go into `Wii Options` -> `Data Management` -> `Save Data` -> `Wii`
	3. Find your Zelda save, click on it, click `Copy`, and then click `Yes`
1. Put your SD card in your computer, and copy the `private` folder from the card to a safe location
2. Copy the `private` directory from the Twilight Hack download to the root of your SD card
3. Take your homebrew Wii executable (elf or dol file) and save it in the root directory of your SD card as "boot.elf" or "boot.dol" as appropriate.
4. Put your SD card in your Wii and power it on
5. Go into `Wii Options` -> `Data Management` -> `Save Data` -> `Wii`
6. Find your Zelda save, click on it, click `Erase`, and then click `Yes`
7. Open the SD card and select the `Twilight Hack` save that corresponds to your game region
   Note: Some people are having problems with the Wii not "seeing" the save file on the SD card. If you are experiencing this, try setting the archive bit for the `data.bin` file - in Windows this can be either be done from the file's properties dialog (right click on it in Windows Explorer and check the box) or from the command line using `attrib +a <path to data.bin>`. More info at #wiihelp on Efnet.
8. Click `copy` and then click `yes`, then exit out of the menu
9. If you are using System Menu 3.4, you must immediately put the Twilight Hack to use
   Turning off or running some other channel or game will have the System Menu delete the savegame again, and you'll have to start over
10. Insert `The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess` game disc and launch the game
   If you have the USA version of the game, load the `TwilightHack0` or `TwilightHack2` versions of the game as appropriate (see above)
   Otherwise, load the only `Twilight Hack` save game
11. Once in the game, either walk backwards or talk to the man standing in front of you
12. Follow the instructions listed on the screen
13. Enjoy!
